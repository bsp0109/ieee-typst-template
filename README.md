# IEEE [Typst](https://typst.app) template

This template is my edition of the template provided by [Typst](https://typst.app)
to match my requirements, the only edit to the actual [template](template.typ) is 
just the font and the size of the title's font. The rest is just boilerplate code 
that I'll write anyway.

## Usage:

Refer to [Typst's Github](https://github.com/typst/typst)
